        <p>Experience the natural beauty of Newfoundland's rugged coastline with our family two-day hiking <br> package. On day one, you'll start your adventure on the Tinkers Point Path route, which takes you from <br> the charming community of Mobile to the scenic Tors Cove. Along the way, you'll be treated to stunning <br> views of the Atlantic Ocean and the surrounding coastline, as well as the chance to spot wildlife such as <br> whales and seabirds. This hike is perfect for novice hikers, with a total distance of approximately 5 km. </p>
        <p>On day two, you'll tackle the La Manche Village Path route, which takes you from Tors Cove to the <br>  historic La Manche Village. This hike is slightly longer than the previous day, at approximately 6.4 km, <br> but still suitable for novice hikers. Along the way, you'll cross over beautiful suspension bridges and pass <br> by crystal-clear streams and waterfalls. At the end of the trail, you'll have the opportunity to explore the <br> remains of the abandoned La Manche Village, which was destroyed by a tsunami in 1929. </p>
