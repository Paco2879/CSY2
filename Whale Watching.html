        <p>Join us for a thrilling family/group activity that combines the excitement of whale watching with the <br> traditional Newfoundland pastime of cod jigging. </p>
        <P>We'll start our adventure with a scenic boat ride along the beautiful coastline of Conception Bay, where <br> we'll have the chance to spot majestic whales breaching and blowing. Our experienced guide will <br> provide interesting facts about these incredible creatures and their behavior in the wild. </P>
        <p>Once we've had our fill of whale watching, we'll head to a prime fishing spot where we'll try our hand at <br> cod jigging. Our guide will provide all the necessary equipment and teach us the techniques needed to <br> catch our own fresh cod. It's a hands-on experience that's sure to create lasting memories. </p>
        <p>After a successful day on the water, we'll bring our catch back to shore and enjoy a delicious seafood <br> feast, cooked to perfection by Chef Asano. It's the perfect way to cap off an unforgettable day spent <br> exploring the natural wonders of Newfoundland. </p>
